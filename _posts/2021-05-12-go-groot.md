GRoot is a very simple url Redirection server written in `Golang`. This can be used to shorten your favorite long urls to something you'd easily remember and enables you to visit them by minimal key presses. 

###### Repo : [imthor/groot](https://github.com/imthor/groot.git) 

##### Why GRoot?

I have been writing code in `Python` for the past couple of years. Never really got a chance to explore different languages so far until now. `Rust` and `Golang` even though they had my attention for a long time, I never really got to play around using them. 

Having worked on some web servers in python previously, I thought will start poking around Go making a simple server in go. GRoot is first among the many such experiments.

##### Learning process

- I started off by referring the [Go by Example: HTTP Servers](https://gobyexample.com/http-servers) on [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/http-servers). This website so far is the best resource I could find on `Golang`
- Played around with custom handlers and different data available in `*http.Request` variable
- Once I had rough static handler working, I tried setting it up to read from a `yaml` file - this is when I added `io/ioutil` and `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` package.
- Coming from `Python`, struggled a bit to get the `marshalling` right.
- Post that tried improving on the `error handling` and tidying up the `log` bit
- Well, now it was time to add support to accept some `cmdline arguments` and call it a day. [Go by Example: Command-Line Flags](https://gobyexample.com/command-line-flags) came in handy for reference.

##### Build & Installation
- Clone the repo [imthor/groot](https://github.com/imthor/groot.git) 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/imthor/groot.git
```
- Get into the `groot` folder
```bash
$ cd groot
```
- Build using `go build`
```bash
$ go build
```
- Copy to `/usr/local/bin`
```bash
$ sudo cp groot /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo cp config.yaml /usr/local/etc/groot.yaml
```
- Starting groot locally
```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/groot -config="/usr/local/etc/groot.yaml" -ipPort=":8090"                                                                
2021/05/12 13:18:05 Redirect Config file reloaded successfully                                                                          
2021/05/12 13:18:05 Starting server..
2021/05/12 13:18:47 /g: Redirected to https://www.google.com 
```

You should be able to see it in action from your browser. 
If you type [http://localhost:8090/license](http://localhost:8090/license) - it should redirect you to `https://exygy.com/blog/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl` as per the config file.

If you try from your cli you should see the following -
```bash
$ curl localhost:8090/license
<a href="https://exygy.com/blog/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl/">Moved Permanently</a>.

```

##### Starting as a systemd service
- Create a new file `/etc/systemd/system/groot.service` with the following content. 

```ini
[Unit]
Description=GRoot Redirection Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=<username>
Group=<username>
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/groot -config="/usr/local/etc/groot.yaml" -ipPort=":8090"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
- Make sure to replace `<username>` with the user you'd like to run this service as.

- Run the following commands to Reload systemd manager configuration and start the service

```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable groot.service
$ sudo systemctl start groot.service
# to check the status of the service
$ sudo systemctl status groot.service

```

##### Update `/etc/hosts`
The point of having this server is to minimize the number of keys we have press to reach our favorite or frequently visited websites. So we can do better than `localhost` by simply adding the following entry to the bottom of your `/etc/hosts` which should enable us to use `r` as the hostname.

```
127.0.1.1       r
```

Once you add and save this file, you should now be able to access our redirect server by visiting [http://r:8090/license](http://r:8090/license) on your browser.

```bash
$ curl r:8090/license
<a href="https://exygy.com/blog/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl/">Moved Permanently</a>.

```

##### Updating Redirect Config

- Open the config file `/usr/local/etc/groot.yaml` on your favorite editor

- Add/Edit entries as you'd like.
```yaml
redirect:
    license: https://exygy.com/blog/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl/
    bible: https://www.catholic.org/bible/daily_reading/
    covid: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance-publications?publicationtypes=01bc799c-b461-4a52-8c7d-294c84cd7b2d
```

- GRoot server has a `/reload` route to which you can send a `GET` request to instruct the server to **reload** the configuration file.
```bash
$ curl r:8090/reload
Config reloaded successfully!⏎
```
You can also restart the systemd service to have the server read the updated configuration file.
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart groot.service
```

##### Future Enhancements
- Write **Unit Tests**

- Convert it into a **proxy search engine** - that once configured on your browser can add support for smart bookmarks, example -
```
gh imthor/groot -> redirects to https://github.com/imthor/groot
yt baby shark   -> redirects to https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=baby+shark
ya baby shark   -> redirects to https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=baby+shark
du baby shark   -> redirects to https://duckduckgo.com/?q=baby+shark
...
```

- Move to a **database oriented approach** for configuration storage with **authentication**, **authorization** and support for **per user configuration**. With this model GRoot can be moved to cloud from where you can use this functionality from anywhere any any of your device.

- Add **comments** everywhere
